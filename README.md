# Blog – A11y Project Showcase

A modern Next.js blog developed as a showcase for accessibility (a11y) practice and skills recycling. This project demonstrates clean, semantic components, thoughtful colour contrast, keyboard navigation, and pragmatic ARIA usage where appropriate. It aims to be a practical, evolving reference for accessible frontend patterns.
